# Pomodoro Coder

---

This site records the growth of an aspiring coder with the help of the pomodoro technique. Each article about coding will be no more than 25 minutes.

We will include the study notes for the following resources


### [1. Udacity](/udacity/)

{{%expand "more" %}}
I just finished Udacityâ€™s Deep Learning Nano-Degree, which helped me with a guaranteed spot in their famous Self-Driving Car Nano-Degree. My goal for 2018 is to successfully graduate from this nano-degree and apply deep learning/AI to a technology that will fundamentally transform the human history again

### [2. Udemy](/udemy/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
The qualities of udemy courses vary depending on the instructors. Personally I only find the following instructors extremely valuable:

* All of Jose Portilla's data science courses. I purchased all of his courses taught in English and enjoyed most of them. Jose is able to explain concepts very clearly. The only downside is he deliberately speaks at a very slow speed, which is understandable. I usually watched his tutorials with 2x speed. I believe he's really great with Python. However the Data Science Bootcamp in R course is less impressive. Also I'm not a fan of his Django Full Stack Web Developer course. There are better web development courses out there

* All of Frank Kane's big data course. Frank has years of experience as a data engineer working at Amazon and IMDB. I think this is a good complement to Jose's data science collections. Frank provides more focus on latest technologies such as elasticsearch, hadoop, spark rather than data science in Python, which is the focal point of Jose's course

* Colt Steele and his team provide the best bootcamp course on full stack web development. Watch them, learn from them and go out there build stuffs

### [3. DataCamp](/datacamp/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
They have the best in class tutorials in R. Some Python courses are great but I am most satisfied with their R courses

### [4. DataQuest](/dataquest/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
I really like their project based approach. This is just a personal thing, but the skills learnt here can actually stick with me compared to DataCamp. However I really wish they could do better with the interface.

### [5. Pluralsight](/pluralsight/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
I like their programming paths. Also the depth of courses at Pluralsight seems to be better than those offered at Lynda

### [6. Front End Master](/frontendmaster/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
This is my new favorite. Kyle Simpson's Deep Javascrip Foundations is a must watch. I also like the courses offered by Bianca Gandolfo. Highly recommend Data Structures and Algorithms in Javascript

### [7. Youtube](/youtube/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
You can learn a lot by binging youtube video tutorials. 

* I highly recommend this [Pandas tutorial from Brandon Rhodes](https://youtu.be/5JnMutdy6Fw)

* For whatever reason, I always wanted to learn emacs and I was not able to find a lot of great emacs video tutorials out there until I found this amazing Emacs meetup hosted by thoughtbot in NYC. I tried to go there once a month. They also upload videos on youtube. This [Getting Started with Org Mode](https://youtu.be/SzA2YODtgK4) video is extremely helpful to learn Org Mode and config your emacs elegantly

### [8. Lynda](/lynda/)
{{%expand "more" %}}
What I really like about Lynda is their programming foundation series, particularly those taught by Simon Allardice. It offers a very beginner-friendly start, however I won't feel confident of creating on my own if I only rely on Lynda courses. It's a good start yet with limited depth.


Also from my personal perspective, I wish they were never got acquired by Linkedin which, I wish, was never got bought out by MicroSoft...
