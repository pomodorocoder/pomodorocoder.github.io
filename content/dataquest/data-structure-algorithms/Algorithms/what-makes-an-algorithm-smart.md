So far, we've been working with linear search, which is a fairly basic algorithm. When we need to perform more complicated tasks, algorithms can become very involved, especially considering that many different ones can achieve the same result.

With multiple algorithms to choose from, a programmer has to make trade-offs and decide which algorithm best suits his or her needs. The most common factor to consider is time complexity.

Time complexity is a measurement of how much time an algorithm takes with respect to its input size. Algorithms with smaller time complexities generally take less time and are more desirable.
