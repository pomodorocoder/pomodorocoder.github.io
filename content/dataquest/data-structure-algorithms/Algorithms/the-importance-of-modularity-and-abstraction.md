As algorithms become more complex, it's important to make sure the code remains modular.

Modular code consists of smaller chunks that we can reuse for other things. The most common way to make code modular is to use functions.

Abstraction is the idea that someone can use our code to perform an operation without having to worry about how we wrote or implemented it.

The sum() function exhibits both modularity and abstraction. We don't know exactly how the function is implemented, and we don't need to; we only need to know what it does. That makes it abstract. It also saves us the work of having to manually compute sums in many parts of our code. That makes it modular.
