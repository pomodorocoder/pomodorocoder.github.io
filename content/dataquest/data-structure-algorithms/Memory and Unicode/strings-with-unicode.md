ASCII is a subset of Unicode. Unicode implements all of the ASCII characters, as well as the additional characters that code points allow.

This lets us create Unicode strings that combine both ASCII and Unicode characters.

By default, Python 3 uses Unicode for all strings, and encodes them with UTF-8. That means we can enter the Unicode code points or the actual characters.
